This React Native bug manifests when using AsyncStorage within a functional component that utilizes the useState hook. The issue arises from the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage's getItem method, where the initial state of the state variable may not reflect the value retrieved from AsyncStorage before the component renders, causing display issues or unexpected behavior.  The problem becomes more pronounced with complex state updates triggered by data loaded from AsyncStorage.
