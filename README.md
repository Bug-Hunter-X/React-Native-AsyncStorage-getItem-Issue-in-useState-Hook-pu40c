# React Native AsyncStorage Bug in useState Hook

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using AsyncStorage's getItem method within a React Native functional component that uses the useState hook.  The asynchronous nature of getItem can lead to the component rendering with stale data before the AsyncStorage value is retrieved.

The `AsyncStorageBug.js` file showcases the bug, while `AsyncStorageBugSolution.js` presents a corrected implementation using useEffect and a loading state to manage asynchronous data retrieval.

## Bug Description

The bug arises because the component renders initially with the default value set in useState, before the asynchronous operation of `AsyncStorage.getItem` completes. This results in a brief display of incorrect or outdated information. 

## Solution

The solution uses the useEffect hook to handle the asynchronous operation.  It introduces a loading state to prevent rendering until the data is fetched from AsyncStorage and the component correctly updates with the retrieved data.
